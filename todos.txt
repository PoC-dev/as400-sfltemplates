- Rework error handling - this will be really hard!
  => Current handler doesn't compile on V3
  => Current handler is very cumbersome to use (base indicator - 10)
  => Can changes be put into a diff, and applied to existing applications?

- Lodpag: Save and restore selections when scolling.
- Probably use RNQxxxx for IBM provided translations of file status error codes
- Why is there a DLTND for load-paged but not for load-all?

Probable bug:
* Load-Paged, more records than one page
* Use pos-to for placing list start on a record which exactly is on the first
  line of the last page of data)
=> No scrolling back!
